# 🍎 Fruit Scratch

Fruit Scratch is an exciting and interactive scratch-off game built with Phaser 3. This is a work in progress and still needs a win screen and potentially other setup screens. The goal of the game is to scratch off the cover and reveal the fruits underneath. If you reveal a certain number of the same fruit, you win!

## 🎮 Gameplay

Scratch off the cover by clicking and dragging the mouse. The area you scratch off will reveal a fruit image underneath.

The game grid is divided into 9 sections, each containing a hidden fruit. If you reveal three of the same fruit, you win!

### 🕹️ Controls

`Scratch`: `Click/Tap -> Drag and release`

## 📋 Features

- Scratch and reveal: Scratching will remove the top layer from the game and reveal which fruit is underneath
- Auto Scratch: When you scratch a certain percent of a grid item, the remainder of the grid item will be auto scratched off
- Particle Reveal: When a grid item is revealed, a particle effect will glow around the item.
